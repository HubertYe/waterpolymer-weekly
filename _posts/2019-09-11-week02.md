**Salutations**

Welcome back fellow readers to my little ol' blog, if you're new here you can look at my first post [here](https://hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019.github.io/waterpolymer-weekly/week01/), otherwise I greet you with a good internet hug! The second week of the semester has come, and with it a new set of questions our professor, Steward Weiss, wants us to answer!

#### What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project? 

In class, professor Weiss went over the history of open source software, and with it, methods people can contribute to to their development. Interestingly, every single person can help out and they don't even need to know how to code! A list of ways can be found [here](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/), which lists ways like translating/creating user documentation to the charitable act of donating.

Personally I love doing feature suggestions and bug reporting. Feature suggestions and bug reporting are relatively easy to do and are in everyone's interest becasue everyone should want to have a better experience with a program/piece of software! Plus they are a great way to complain productively! 

#### What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?

Well... I am extremely interested in archiving games and their accessibility to larger audiances because I have been playing them since I was a wee lass. 

In my experience, not all games are easily playable. Problems can range from platform incompatability, bad installtion guides or limited availability, and these difficulties make it really easy to just give up on getting a game to work, even though you might love if it got up and running. In short perhaps I would like to help in the development of open source emulators?

There has been lots of news as of late about companies going after emulators, (see nintendo taking down emuparadise)[https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/15/17693556/emuparadise-roms-shut-down-threat-nintendo], so I am a little unsure if it would be allowed in the class...

Aaaaand that wrap for this week's post. Thank you internet stranger for reading this week's blog. I hope you'll stick around to next week where I might start contributing to the world!

See ya next week~
