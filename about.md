**Hi there**

My name is Kendrick and I am currently majoring in computer science, with the possiblity of minoring in media studies, at Hunter College. I haven't had the opportunity to gain experience in a professional setting yet, but I am searching (lazily)! I do have some experiences in developing due to class projects as well as my own hobby of recreating simple games in unity, but I do feel like I am lacking overall. 

I'm pretty timid meeting new people in a group , but if it's a small groups I can chat and crack jokes comfortably for days. If you're looking for someone to chat with, or have a job opening and are looking for someone to fill that role, feel free to say hi! 


### Hobbies

My hobbies include:

* Reading about problems and solution in game development  
[see the recent release of classic wow and their developments!](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/q-a-compilation-wow-classic-development-team-ama/260760)
* Playing games
* Watching stand-up comedy shows
* Being a potato
* Listening and discovering new music to add them to my playlists
* Reading manga
* Drawing
* Browsing reddit
* Cat

### What kind of games?

Usually single player RPGs. Zelda, Atelier, Tales of, and Disgaea are some series that come to mind off the top of my head. Game that currently occupying me at the moment are League of Legends, Dragalia Lost and Another Eden.
