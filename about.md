**Hi there**
My name is Kendrick and I am currently a student at Hunter College and majoring in computer science, with the possiblity of earning minoring in media studies. I haven't had the opportunity to gain experience in a professional setting yet, so I am searching for internships, albeit not with much gusto. Most internships require experience I simply don't have, so apply for those positions are quite intimidating. I do have some experiences in developing due to class projects as well as my own hobby of recreating simple games in unity, but I want to expand my knowledge past that.

I'm pretty timid meeting a big group of new people, but I work great in a small group. Give me a small group and I can chat and crack jokes for days. If you're looking for someone to chat with, or you have a job opening and are looking for someone who will work hard to fill that role, feel free to say hi! 


### Hobbies

Some of hobbies include:

* Reading about problems and solution in game development  
[see the recent release of classic wow and their developments!](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/q-a-compilation-wow-classic-development-team-ama/260760)
* Playing games
* Watching stand-up comedy
* Being a potato on a hot day
* Discovering and listening to new music to add them to my playlists
* Reading manga
* Drawing
* Browsing reddit
* Playing with my cat

### What kind of games?

Usually single player RPGs. Two series I play consistantly are Zelda and Atelier. Currently I'm playing two mobile games, one is called Dragalia Lost and the other is Another Eden and they are enjoyable. I also play League of Legends, but it's mostly ARAM.

## I want to know more about your cat!

She's an absolutely lovely fluffball and a derp. Her original name was Sabby, but my fantastic naming sense simply called her meow meow for a long time... and well... the name kinda stuck to her.
