**Hello World!**

Welcome one and welcome all to my first internet blog post! In today's post I'll be entailing why I am taking Open software development and... that's about it really.

I am currently taking Open software development for a couple of reasons:
1. The credits from the class work towards my computer science degree
2. I'm interested in the subject and thought 395 was a neat opportunity to get myself to learn about it
3. I want to get experience in the field but I am too lazy to get into it without some motivation (aka credits/grades on the line)

I would love to write more, but I'm not too sure what topics are allowed to be covered in these posts aside from the assigned question(s) and content. 

I guess that sums up the first post of this semester huh? If you want to learn more about me, I typed a little about myself in the **about** page to your upper right corner, or you can click on this ol' link **[here]**(https://hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019.github.io/waterpolymer-weekly/about/) that I learned from our some-what mandatory **[markup learning tutorial]**(https://www.markdowntutorial.com/). Make sure to check out the about page or the markup tutorial if you're interested o/.

Goodnight world!
